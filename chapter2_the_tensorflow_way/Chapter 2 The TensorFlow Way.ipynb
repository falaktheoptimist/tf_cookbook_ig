    "Let us have a look at the key differences between TensorFlow and other numerical computation library NumPy. One of the main differences is that operations in TensorFlow are nodes in the TF graph and are symbolic. The reason for this is that it allows TensorFlow to do automatic differentiation for the given operation at the backend and also save some computation steps. This is not possible or required with imperative libraries like NumPy. The automatic differentiation speeds up backpropogation, which is a key step in neural networks training. \n",
